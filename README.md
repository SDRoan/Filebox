## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or MongoDB Atlas)

### Setup

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
```bash
npm run install-all
```

2. **Set up environment variables:**

Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory:
```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/dropbox-clone
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

3. **Start MongoDB:**
Make sure MongoDB is running on your system. If using MongoDB Atlas, update the `MONGODB_URI` in `.env`.

4. **Run the application:**

Development mode (runs both server and client):
```bash
npm run dev
```

Or run separately:
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd client
npm start
```

5. **Access the application:**
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000
